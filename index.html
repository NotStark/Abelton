                <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion

                    Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We
                    come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
                    self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that
                    each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future
                    of music culture.

                    always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

                    Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge
                    and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized
                    development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and
                    best practices.

Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.
